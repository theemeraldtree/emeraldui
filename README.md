# emeraldui

## A simple React UI Library

emeraldui is a simple, clean, and easy-to-use React UI Library. It's going to be the UI library that powers [Minecraft Manager](https://github.com/theemeraldtree/minecraft-manager) and any other future projects from theemeraldtree.

### Using emeraldui

emeraldui is currently not on npm; you can install it directly with the git repo, however

```bash
yarn add git://github.com/theemeraldtree/emeraldui
```

It will compile locally, which shouldn't take too long.
You can also upgrade it by running

```bash
yarn upgrade emeraldui
```

### Building emeraldui

You can run and test emeraldui locally through its Storybook server.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/theemeraldtree/emeraldui
yarn
yarn storybook
```
